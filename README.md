# mentor_mentee_practice
This space is for Stetson Kinnison and Aashutosh Pandya at NIQ for the Mentor-Mentee program. Here, Stetson will post his additional/practice work.
The intent is to find a Kaggle dataset, generate various data science-type of insights and analytics, and then display the results and walk through pros/cons with Aashutosh's comments.
